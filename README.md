# CustomerSupportWorkflow_N8N
This n8n workflow automates handling of customer support emails. It connects to Gmail and listens for new incoming messages. Each email is analyzed and classified as either support-related or not. Support emails are routed to an AI agent for response generation. The AI agent uses GPT-4o-mini via OpenRouter to draft friendly replies.
